# Hubot Jira Bot
Lets you search for JIRA tickets, open
them, transition them thru different states, comment on them, rank
them up or down, start or stop watching them or change who is
assigned to a ticket

###Dependencies:
- moment
- octokat
- node-fetch
- underscore
- fuse.js

###Configuration:
- `HUBOT_JIRA_URL` `https://jira-domain.com:9090`
- `HUBOT_JIRA_USERNAME`
- `HUBOT_JIRA_PASSWORD`
- `HUBOT_JIRA_TYPES_MAP`  `{"story":"Story / Feature","bug":"Bug","task":"Task"}`
- `HUBOT_JIRA_PROJECTS_MAP`  `{"web":"WEB","android":"AN","ios":"IOS","platform":"PLAT"}`
- `HUBOT_JIRA_TRANSITIONS_MAP` `[{"name":"triage","jira":"Triage"},{"name":"icebox","jira":"Icebox"},{"name":"backlog","jira":"Backlog"},{"name":"devready","jira":"Selected for Development"},{"name":"inprogress","jira":"In Progress"},{"name":"design","jira":"Design Triage"}]`
- `HUBOT_JIRA_PRIORITIES_MAP` `[{"name":"Blocker","id":"1"},{"name":"Critical","id":"2"},{"name":"Major","id":"3"},{"name":"Minor","id":"4"},{"name":"Trivial","id":"5"}]`
- `HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` - Github Application Token
- `HUBOT_GITHUB_ORG` - Github Organization or Github User

Note that `HUBOT_JIRA_USERNAME` should be the Jira username, this is 
not necessarily the username used if you log in via the web.  To 
determine a user's username, log in as that user via the web, and check
the user profile.  Frequently, users may log in using an email address such
as 'bob@somewhere.com' or a stem, such as 'bob'; these may or may not match
the username in JIRA. Because hubot-jira-bot will create and change tickets,
it is recommended that you create a separate JIRA account for this purpose,
otherwise tickets that the bot creates will show as reported by the human
user's account you specified.
